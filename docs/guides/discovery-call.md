# Discovery Call Guide for Arc Systems

**Purpose:** Qualify leads, assess mutual fit, demonstrate expertise WITHOUT giving away implementation details.

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes maximum

**Goal:** Client leaves thinking "This is more complex than I thought. I need this person." — NOT "Great, now I can build it myself."

---

## 🎯 MINDSET BEFORE THE CALL

### You Are NOT:
- ❌ A free consultant
- ❌ A tech stack recommender
- ❌ An architecture diagram service
- ❌ Desperate for any project

### You ARE:
- ✅ Assessing if they're a good fit for YOU
- ✅ Understanding their business problem (not designing the solution)
- ✅ Demonstrating depth without revealing specifics
- ✅ Surfacing complexity they haven't considered
- ✅ Creating dependency on your expertise

---

## 📋 PRE-CALL PREPARATION

### Research (5 minutes):
- [ ] Check their website/business
- [ ] Review any materials they sent
- [ ] Google their company name
- [ ] Note any red flags (unrealistic expectations, history of burning devs)

### Set Frame:
- This is a **two-way conversation** — you're also evaluating them
- You're the expert; they came to you for a reason
- Your time is valuable

---

## 🗣️ CALL STRUCTURE

### 1. OPENING (2-3 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "Thanks for taking the time to connect. I've got about 30-45 minutes blocked. Before we dive in, I'd love to understand your business and what's driving this project. Then I can share whether we're a good fit and what next steps might look like. Sound good?"

**Why this works:**
- Sets time boundary (implies you're busy/valuable)
- Frames it as mutual assessment ("if we're a good fit")
- You're in control

---

### 2. UNDERSTAND THEIR BUSINESS (5-7 minutes)

**ASK (Business Context):**
- "Tell me about your business. What do you do?"
- "Who are your customers?"
- "What's working well right now?"
- "What's the biggest bottleneck or challenge you're facing?"

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Jump to technical questions
- ❌ Interrupt with solutions
- ❌ Mention any technologies yet

**Why this matters:**
- Most developers skip this — you'll stand out
- Uncovers their REAL problem (often different from what they think)
- Shows you care about business outcomes, not just code

---

### 3. UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT (8-10 minutes)

**ASK (Problem Understanding):**
- "What made you decide now is the time to build this?"
- "Have you tried solving this problem before? What happened?"
- "If this project succeeds, what changes for your business?"
- "What does success look like 6 months after launch?"
- "Who are the key users? What's their technical comfort level?"

**ASK (Constraints):**
- "What's your timeline? Is there a specific deadline driving this?"
- "What's your budget range for this? (Ballpark is fine)"
- "Do you have an internal team that will work on this post-launch?"
- "Any technical constraints we should know about? (existing systems, compliance, etc.)"

**DON'T SAY:**
- ❌ "You should use Next.js with PostgreSQL"
- ❌ "We'll build this with React and Node.js"
- ❌ "Here's the architecture..." [draws diagram]
- ❌ "It'll take X weeks and cost $X" (too specific)

**DO SAY (Demonstrate Depth Without Specifics):**
- ✅ "There are several architectural approaches for this, each with tradeoffs around scalability, cost, and speed."
- ✅ "This involves data pipeline considerations, real-time processing challenges, and integration complexity."
- ✅ "I'm seeing 3-4 different technical paths depending on your long-term roadmap."
- ✅ "The ML component here requires careful consideration of training data, model selection, and inference optimization."

**Surface Complexity They Haven't Considered:**
- ✅ "Have you thought about data sovereignty requirements for UAE?"
- ✅ "How are you planning to handle user authentication and role-based access?"
- ✅ "What's your disaster recovery strategy?"
- ✅ "At scale, this introduces caching and performance optimization needs."
- ✅ "Integration with [system they mentioned] typically involves OAuth flows and webhook management."

**Why this works:**
- Shows you've done this before (pattern recognition)
- Reveals gaps in their thinking
- Makes them realize: "Oh, this is more complex than I thought"
- Creates dependency: "I need someone who understands all this"

---

### 4. ASSESS FIT (5-7 minutes)

**RED FLAGS (Walk away if):**
- Budget is unrealistic (<$5k for complex AI project)
- Timeline is impossible ("Need it in 2 weeks")
- They've burned through multiple developers
- They want you to sign an NDA before discussing anything
- They're asking for free proof of concept
- "We'll pay you in equity" (unless you're interested)
- They use phrases like "quick and easy" or "it's just like Uber but for..."
- They want you to bid against 10 other developers

**GREEN FLAGS (Good fit):**
- Clear business problem
- Reasonable budget and timeline
- Previous attempts show learning
- Respect your expertise
- Ask smart questions
- Understand this is a partnership

**What to say if it's NOT a fit:**
> "Thanks for sharing all this. To be honest, based on what you've described, I don't think we're the right fit. [Reason: timeline, budget, expertise]. I'd recommend [honest advice, maybe refer competitor]. But I appreciate you thinking of Arc Systems."

**Why being honest works:**
- Saves your time
- Builds reputation (honest advisor)
- They might come back later with better project
- Referrals from grateful people you turned down

---

### 5. OUTLINE NEXT STEPS (3-5 minutes)

**If it's a GOOD fit, say:**
> "This sounds like a great fit for what we do. Here's how we'd move forward:
> 
> 1. I'll put together a **detailed technical proposal** that outlines:
>    - Our recommended architecture and technical approach
>    - Implementation roadmap with phases
>    - Timeline breakdown
>    - Transparent pricing with line-item breakdown
>    - Team structure and communication plan
> 
> 2. The proposal takes 2-3 business days to prepare because we do proper technical analysis.
> 
> 3. Once you review it, we can schedule another call to walk through the proposal, answer questions, and adjust if needed.
> 
> 4. If we're aligned, we move to contracts (MSA and SOW) and kick off.
> 
> Sound good?"

**What NOT to say:**
- ❌ "Let me send you a quote" (too vague)
- ❌ "It'll cost around $X" (never quote on first call)
- ❌ "I can start next week" (seems desperate)

---

### 6. HANDLE COMMON OBJECTIONS

**"Can you give me a ballpark price now?"**
> "I could throw out a number, but it wouldn't be accurate without proper analysis. Every project has nuances. I'd rather give you a detailed, honest quote in the proposal than a guess that's off by 50%. Fair?"

**"Can you just tell me what tech stack to use?"**
> "Absolutely, and that'll be in the proposal along with the rationale. The right stack depends on your specific constraints, team capabilities, and growth plans — I need to think through those tradeoffs carefully."

**"We're talking to other developers. What makes you different?"**
> "Smart approach. Here's what clients tell us: We combine deep AI/ML expertise with full-stack capabilities, so you're not coordinating multiple vendors. We're senior-level on every project — no juniors learning on your dime. And our proposals are detailed technical documents, not sales pitches. You'll know exactly what you're getting."

**"Can you build a proof of concept first?"**
> "POCs are great for validating technical feasibility. If that's needed, we'd scope that as a standalone paid engagement (typically 1-2 weeks, $X-$Y range). Then you own that code and can decide whether to continue with full development. Make sense?"

**"This is urgent. Can you start immediately?"**
> "I understand the urgency. The fastest path is actually starting with proper planning. Jumping in without a clear technical plan costs more time and money later. We can prioritize the proposal and turn it around in 1-2 business days. If approved, we can start within a week."

---

## 🚫 NEVER REVEAL

### Tech Stack Specifics
- ❌ "Use Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, deployed on Vercel"
- ✅ "A modern web framework, scalable database layer, caching strategy, and optimized cloud infrastructure"

### Architecture Diagrams
- ❌ Drawing out system architecture
- ✅ "There are several architectural patterns we could use — API-driven, event-driven, or hybrid"

### Feature-by-Feature Cost Breakdown
- ❌ "Authentication is $2k, dashboard is $5k, AI model is $8k"
- ✅ "The proposal will break down costs by implementation phase"

### Implementation Timeline Details
- ❌ "Week 1-2: Auth, Week 3-4: Dashboard, Week 5-6: AI integration"
- ✅ "This typically takes 6-10 weeks depending on scope refinements"

### Code Patterns or Specific Libraries
- ❌ "You'll want to use LangChain with OpenAI, store embeddings in Pinecone"
- ✅ "This requires an LLM orchestration layer, vector database for embeddings, and retrieval optimization"

---

## ✅ DO REVEAL (Strategic Information)

### Process and Working Style
- ✅ "We work in 2-week sprints with weekly updates"
- ✅ "You get a dedicated Slack channel and regular demos"
- ✅ "All code is yours, professionally documented"

### Complexity Factors
- ✅ "AI projects have inherent uncertainty in model performance"
- ✅ "Integrations are often the hidden time sink"
- ✅ "Scaling to 10k+ users requires different architecture than MVP"

### Your Expertise and Experience
- ✅ "We've built 3 similar RAG systems for other clients"
- ✅ "I've worked with this type of real-time data pipeline before"
- ✅ "AI agent orchestration is our core strength"

### High-Level Approach Options
- ✅ "We could go with a rapid MVP approach (6 weeks, core features) or full-scale launch (12 weeks, polished)"
- ✅ "There's a build vs buy decision on [specific component] — both have merits"

---

## 🧠 LANGUAGE TRANSLATION GUIDE

### When you think tech jargon, say this instead:

| ❌ Tech Speak | ✅ Business Speak |
|---|---|
| "We'll use a microservices architecture" | "We'll build this as independent modules that can scale separately" |
| "PostgreSQL with Redis caching" | "A robust database with performance optimization layer" |
| "Next.js with server-side rendering" | "A modern web framework optimized for speed and SEO" |
| "LangChain with RAG" | "An AI system that can search your knowledge base and provide accurate answers" |
| "OAuth 2.0 integration" | "Secure authentication with your existing systems" |
| "CI/CD pipeline with automated testing" | "Automated quality checks and deployment process" |
| "WebSocket for real-time updates" | "Live updates without page refresh" |
| "Kubernetes orchestration" | "Automated server management and scaling" |
| "Vector embeddings in Pinecone" | "Semantic search capabilities for intelligent matching" |
| "ETL pipeline with Airflow" | "Automated data processing and transformation system" |

## 🎭 EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD RESPONSES

### Scenario: "How would you build our AI chatbot?"

**❌ BAD (Too Specific):**
> "I'd use Next.js for the frontend, Node.js backend with Express, integrate OpenAI's GPT-4 API, store conversation history in PostgreSQL, use Redis for caching, deploy on AWS with Lambda functions for the chat endpoint, and use Pinecone for vector storage of your knowledge base."

**✅ GOOD (Strategic Vagueness with Demonstrated Expertise):**
> "Great question. There are several architectural approaches depending on your specific needs. At a high level, we'd need: a scalable web interface, AI orchestration layer to manage the conversation flow, knowledge retrieval system for accuracy, and conversation persistence. The key decisions revolve around response latency requirements, expected user volume, and how much customization you need in the AI's behavior. I'll detail the recommended approach with technical rationale in the proposal."

---

### Scenario: "What will this cost?"

**❌ BAD:**
> "Probably $15-20k."

**✅ GOOD:**
> "Based on what you've described, this falls into the range of a 6-10 week project. Our typical projects in this complexity range are $20-40k, but that's a wide range because the specifics matter — integrations, AI model customization, scale requirements, etc. I'll provide a detailed breakdown in the proposal with options at different scope levels. Fair enough?"

---

### Scenario: "We have a tight budget. Can you work with $5k?"

**❌ BAD:**
> "Sure, no problem!" (You'll regret this)

**✅ GOOD:**
> "I appreciate the transparency on budget. To be honest, what you're describing is typically a $25-35k project done properly. At $5k, we couldn't deliver a production-ready system with the features you need. What we *could* do is a phased approach: Phase 1 would be a proof of concept focusing on [core feature], which validates the AI approach and gives you something to test with early users. That might fit your budget and de-risks the larger investment. Interested in exploring that?"

## 🚀 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### The "Layered Complexity" Technique
When they describe a "simple" feature:
> "That's the user-facing simplicity, which is great. Behind that, there's [authentication, data validation, error handling, edge cases, security, performance optimization]. The craft is making complexity feel simple."

### The "Strategic Questions" Technique
Make them think deeper:
> "Have you considered what happens when [edge case]?"
> "How do you want to handle [scenario they didn't mention]?"
> "What's your strategy for [growth/scaling concern]?"

This positions you as the strategic thinker and reveals gaps in their planning.

### The "Options Framework" Technique
Never give ONE answer:
> "There are typically 3 approaches: Quick MVP, Balanced, or Enterprise-grade. Each has tradeoffs in cost, timeline, and scalability. In the proposal, I'll recommend one based on your constraints and explain why."

Shows you're thoughtful, not prescriptive.

## 💼 WHEN TO WALK AWAY

Trust your gut. Walk away if:
- They treat you like a code monkey, not a partner
- Budget is <$10k for complex AI work
- They're disrespectful of your time
- They want you to work for free first
- They've burned 3+ developers before you
- They want to "test" you with unpaid work
- The project requires expertise you don't have (and can't learn quickly)
- Something feels off

**Remember:** Saying no to bad clients creates space for great clients.
